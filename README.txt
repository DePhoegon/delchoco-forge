Welcome to the Wonderful World of Chocobos.

This mod is intended to be with DePhoegons' Reclaim  [ Is on forge & on Github ]

Currently, in active development to fix 'Chococraft 4' for 1.18.2 & theme it for my Decorative & resource reclaiming, Vanilla+ like mod.
-Please forgive me as I am learning as I go & working with ...  unfamiliar bits & bobs because I REALLY want chocobos myself & no one else was seeming to do it.

The Press files include the change & by date.

Actual Jar files will be start to  archived here when they are near release date.
-- Failing & attempting to put them into a beta release on Curseforge  {DePhoegons' Chocobos}

There are many changes coming, and some visual rework on other things.

I can provide an updated version of it, if requested.  It is 'stable' with 1 known (to me) bug around taking packs/bags off the chocobos without emptying their items inventory first.  This will take time to figure out & may not be sorted easily (still learning my way around all the forge, java, & MC silliness.

Future plans around chocobos
- Reworking what each chocobo has
- Reworking where they can spawn

Some future updates to be hand.

-- Is a modpack meant around chocobos, exploration, Horses, & Llamas, and decoration around larger animal stall style building.
-This is the main mod it will 'require', future plans will call for blocks that exist within this mod.

I can produce a depenancy free version (from my mod), but it will still require
-JEI (for now, just bad book in it atm)
-Configured (just highly suggested)
-Patchouli (Guide Book)  - Not yet put in.

Naming Now works Correctly, and  So does the stat screen
